# amazon-clone-html-css
This project is my attempt to recreate the look and feel of Amazon.com using just HTML and CSS. It's a static site, meaning it doesn't have any backend functionality, but it visually mimics key pages from Amazon, like the homepage, product listings, and product detail pages.
